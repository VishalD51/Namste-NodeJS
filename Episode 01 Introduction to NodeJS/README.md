# Episode 1: Introduction to Node.js

## What is Node.js?

Node.js is a **runtime environment** that executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser by running the **V8 JavaScript engine** (originally developed for Chrome). Unlike traditional JavaScript used in browsers, Node.js enables JavaScript to operate on servers, desktops, and embedded systems, giving rise to the phrase **"Run JavaScript Everywhere."**

### Key Features of Node.js
- **Event-driven architecture**: Handles requests through asynchronous (non-blocking) operations.
- **Asynchronous I/O**: Ideal for handling multiple requests with fewer resources.

Node.js is maintained by the **OpenJS Foundation**.

## History of Node.js

Here's a concise timeline of Node.js development milestones:

| Year      | Event |
|-----------|-------|
| **2009**  | **Node.js Created** - Ryan Dahl develops Node.js, initially experimenting with the SpiderMonkey engine before switching to V8. |
| **2009**  | **Joyent Funding** - Joyent hires Ryan Dahl to further develop Node.js, contributing significant support. |
| **2009**  | **Renamed to Node.js** - Originally called Web.js, it was renamed to Node.js to reflect broader applications beyond web servers. |
| **2010**  | **NPM Launched** - Node Package Manager (NPM) launches, providing a package management ecosystem critical to Node.js's success. |
| **2011**  | **Windows Support** - Node.js extends support to Microsoft Windows, broadening its accessibility. |
| **2012**  | **NPM Leadership** - Isaac Z. Schlueter begins maintaining Node.js and further develops NPM. |
| **2014**  | **Fork of io.js** - A Node.js fork, io.js, emerges, resulting in development by a separate team of developers. |
| **2015**  | **Node.js Foundation** - io.js merges back into Node.js under the new Node.js Foundation. |
| **2019**  | **OpenJS Foundation** - The JS Foundation and Node.js Foundation merge, creating the OpenJS Foundation, which now oversees Node.js development. |

This timeline captures the major events that shaped Node.js, from its inception to its current maintenance by the OpenJS Foundation.
